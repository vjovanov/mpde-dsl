   * If all required values are present DSL compilation (staging) can be done completely at compile time. 
   * Otherwise compilation is done at runtime.
   * 
   * Idea: Add the warning system for compilation that is moved to runtime.
   * Idea: An optimization step (or analysis phase) can follow the decision on weather the required values are present. 
   *   - matches("texttomatch", "text" + "to" + "match") should be accepted at compilation time. This requires DSL developer input since context of operations is unknown.   
   * 
   * Pros: Reduced initial runtime cost. 
   *       Additional analysis that can be done at compile time that is not type system related.    
   * 
   * Cons: Nothing
   * 
   * Scala implementation for compile time generation:
   *   If staging is run at compile time the macro should produce:
   *     val code = eval {
   *       val dsl = new DSL {
   *         def main() = body
   *       }
   *       dsl.generateCode
   *     }
   *     addToClassPath(new ScalaCompiler.compile(code))
   *     
   *     c.Expr[T](newMethod(missing parameters))
   *     // how to inject Scala code here and compile it again?
   *       // 1. It is doable with quasiquotes. 
   *       // 2. the method can be generated with all the missing values as arguments
   *          Add an object to the class path with the DSL method: 
   *     )
   * 
   * On the DSL side:
   *   The DSL must support holes in its framework. The holes must have a name and a type. The names of all holes must be in the method signature. 
   *   Also the order of the holes must match the order that the macro will give.
